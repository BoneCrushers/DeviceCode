A simple file that will be used for planning and plotting 
different problems, current and future, to overcome. Unsure as of yet,
but may include research/notes.

Overflow problem ***WIP***



Integer to bytes problem ***WIP***
currently, when we have a value we want to convert to bytes, we use this line:
[*DATA*%256, *DATA*//256]
to get the lower and upper 8 bits respectively for each byte as an integer with a range of (0, 255) then convert that to bytes. This worked until now only because we used the W channel, which is only positive.
in order to start combining channels, we need to be able to convert an integer to bytes, with a couple of rules:
    the number of bytes per int conversion CANNOT exceed 2
    overflow must be dealt with in a clean manner, (if it exists at all, which my understanding is it should) either by setting the value to maxint or 0, or 
        should we have overflow? its possible this shouldnt be an issue at all with the correct equations/math. 
Use reference Screenshots when explaining: W output alone is multiplied by sqrt(2) for 0 decibel attenuation. (may be related to the notes saying W channel is encoded with a -3 dB attenuation?) For us, this would break it because any value between 65535/sqrt(2) (46340) and 65535, about a third of our total possible values, would overflow. No bueno



Equations:
Range of input: (should this be unsigned? works as unsigned... W should always be positive, as it is a total sum of sound, regardless of direction. )
    W= (0, 65535)
    X= (0, 65535)
    Y= (0, 65535)
    Z= (0, 65535)
Peculiar similarities among some data?
ranges are as above, but there are some smaller ranges which are much more common.
ex. after being split up into </> 30000 (basically upper and lower half), the average per chunk for W is rarely above 1000 on the lower end and below 64700 on the upper end, with no values at all between approx 51000 and 4500, a *massive* range of data to randomly have zero plot points. Note, this is with the volume function set to 1, which should mean there is no effect on the channel values there.
Pt. 2:
For the equations themselves, I have been using sin/cos as a way of getting the vertical, horizontal and depth components of sound, which I thought was clever but clearly isnt working. Shown when a likely small sound at the very start of the track,  
When combining angles




Audio Normalization ***WIP***
idea for audio normalization: (*Probably wont work*)
curavg = average samples for (each channel OR less likely overall?),  
    select size based on fraction of FRAME_RATE or chunk size (whichever is smaller)
        *may need to use consistent fraction of chunk size to avoid averages of different sizes*
average prevavg and curavg (init prevavg at 0, should cause a very quick fade-in.)
    lasting impact of each average taken will be 1/2^n where n is the number of frames ago it came
Unsure: Add/Subtract from each channel or Multiply samples by percentage of the max int that curavg is.
    +/-: (possible unintended impact on values near 0?)
    x: (seems computationally expensive)


virtual speaker and virtual microphone is identical

Other things to discuss with flint:

22 or 20 valid bits per sample (cant remember which, but point is it didnt line up with >) when using 16 bit integers. Intentional or not, am I missing some other piece of info

No matching format for the header subformat header, '\x10\x003\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00' should line up with either a 4 character an 8 character or an 8 character ascii string for the Codec ID with bytes in reverse order.

review twos complement
todo:
formatter/reader
will need to take in


Problem with clicking is in the rounding somewhere, it is heard when outputting just the W channel without any calculations
